# Finding and using international data

Date and time: Saturday, 10:15-11:15 a.m.
Location: Galerie 6, 2nd floor

## About me

- Work at Global Witness (GW), an NGO focussing on corruption in the natural resources sector 
- Based in London
- Joined GW from *The Times* of London (TT) about a year ago

## From Britain to the world

- TT is the UK's paper of record - it has a very particular role and a strong focus on home news
- GW is relatively small but works worldwide: offices in London, D.C., Brussels and China, campaigns in 23 countries (according to website)
- My role is to help teams working on all these different countries with data journalism - difficult to get your head around!

## How to cope

1. Use your colleagues. Seek out the most data-literate (or at least data-curious) person in a team and pump them for info. How do they usually do their work? Are there easy wins to be had through scraping? What are they missing?

2. Use the community. Has data for the country in question already been scraped by [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com/)?
Does OCCRP have relevant structured data or documents in [Aleph](https://aleph.occrp.org/)? Is the country publishing under the [Open Contracting standard](https://www.open-contracting.org/worldwide/)?

3. Go commercial. Do you have access to any subscription databases that might hold relevant data, e.g. [Orbis](https://orbis.bvdinfo.com/) for corporate records or Bloomberg/Eikon for commercial data?

3. Go supra-national. Is the country an EU member state, for example? If so, you can get their contracting data through [TED](https://ted.europa.eu/).

3. Work out what's missing and go to the source. Key things to search for:

    a. Corporate registry
    b. Land registry or cadastre
    c. Sources for specific industries, e.g. a cadastre for mining licenses

   Try to work out the names for each of these in the local language to speed up your Googling.
